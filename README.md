Credit Card Fraud Detection System
This project is a machine learning-based application for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. The backend leverages a balanced dataset, feature engineering, and a trained model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. The frontend, built using Streamlit, provides an interactive interface for users to input transaction features and view predictions. Custom styling enhances user experience with a visually appealing background and intuitive input fields. The app also includes error handling for input validation, ensuring smooth functionality.
